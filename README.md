# **API Automation Project**

This project aims to automate API tests using the **RestAssured** framework for integration testing and **JUnit** for the test structure. The project is organized to test specific functionalities of an API.

## **Project Structure**

The project is divided as follows:

```bash
 src
 └── test
      └── java
            ├── base      → Base classes for global configuration and initialization
            ├── config    → Environment and endpoint configurations
            ├── services  → Implementations of API calls
            ├── utils     → Utilities, data generators and JSON handlers
      └── org.test.api    → Test classes organized by functionality
            └── auth      → Authentication test classes
            └── product   → Product test classes
            └── user      → User test classes
```

* **target**: Folder generated by Maven after test execution, containing build artifacts and execution reports.
* **pom.xml**: Automatically generated file where dependencies, plugins, build configurations, and other parameters required to build and manage the project are defined.

## **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you will need:

* **Java 8 or higher**: Make sure you have **JDK 8** or higher installed.
* **Maven 3.6 or higher**: For managing dependencies and running tests.
* **IDE of your choice**: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse is recommended to make code navigation and test execution easier.

## **Project Setup**

**Install the dependencies:**

Use Maven to install all project dependencies:

```bash
mvn install
```

**If you encounter any issues with dependencies, simply go to the Maven menu and perform a Reload of the project files.**

## **Running the Tests**

You can run the tests using Maven or directly through your IDE.

Using Maven:
To run all tests at once, execute:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will run all the tests configured in the project and generate an execution report inside the target folder.

## **Running a Specific Test**

To run a specific test, use the following command:

```bash
mvn -Dtest=TestClassName test
```

Example for running the AuthTest:

```bash
mvn -Dtest=AuthTest test
```

## **Bug Found**

During the test **"shouldGenerateTokenSuccessfully"**, the following is returned:

`org.test.api.ApiTestException: Error creating authentication token: 1 expectation failed.
JSON path token doesn't match.
Expected: not null
  Actual: null`

This means that the API response does not contain the "token" field. In other words, the login attempt was not successful — the API returned an error (likely 400 or 401), and therefore the token field is null.

The same test was executed via Postman, returning the same message.

Due to this authentication issue, product tests that require authentication also fail.

## **Logs**

The **log().all()** method was implemented at the end of all test scripts to display the result data of each executed test.

## **Report**

The **Maven Surefire Report Plugin** was implemented to visualize test results. After test execution, the results are stored in:

```bash
target/surefire-reports
```

This folder contains XML files for all executed tests.

## **Pipeline**

A Jenkinsfile was created to execute the tests in a CI pipeline.
